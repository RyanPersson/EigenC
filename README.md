# EigenC
A Linear Algebra library in C++

# Pre reqs
To test out, first ensure you have G++ & make set up on your machine. run:

>which g++
You should see: 
>/usr/bin/g++

then run:

>which make
you should see
>/usr/bin/make

If either of these fail, you can install them by running
>sudo apt-get install build-essential

# To Run:

Once you've ensured make & g++ are installed, run:

>git clone https://github.com/RyanPersson/EigenC.git

>make

>./test_matrix

You should see the output from several matrix functions. You can play around with this library by editing test_matrix.cpp & running 

run
>make clean
then 
>make
to clean & rebuild between edits.
